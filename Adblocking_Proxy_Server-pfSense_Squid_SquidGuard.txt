Install SquidGuard package
  SquidGuard is necessary, beacuse without it Squid alone is not able to filter URLs.

Configure SquidGuard package
  

Everytime we change the configuration of Squid or SquidGuardian, the SquidGuard service needs to be restarted.
In order to do so, we need to perform the "Update procedure", to force the loading of new settings.
  Update procedure:
    Uncheck "Enable SquidGuard". This disables SquidGuard.
    Click on "Save" button on the bottom of the page. Wait, until the page finishes loading.
    Click on "Apply" button underneath the checkbox "Enable SquidGuard". Wait, until the page finishes loading.
    Check "Enable SquidGuard". This enables SquidGuard.
    Click on "Save" button on the bottom of the page. Wait, until the page finishes loading.
    Click on "Apply" button underneath the checkbox "Enable SquidGuard". Wait, until the page finishes loading.
