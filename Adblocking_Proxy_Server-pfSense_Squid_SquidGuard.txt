Adblocking Proxy: pfSense + Squid + SquidGuard

pfSense provides a centralized solution to control network traffic.
With combination with Squid and SquidGuard it is able to block HTTP
and HTTPS URLs, unlike Privoxy, which I used previously.
pfSense had been installed into VirtualBox. The computer, as well as the virtual machine
had only one network card.

This tutorial I will explain, how to install pfSense on HDD and SSD seperately.
Beacuse SSD is a flash storage, such as memory cards, it needs special treatment.
But the HDD and SSD install are very similar.

I preffer SSD install over HDD, beacuse is more flexible and it's faster than the
HDD install. Also, the SSD install seems to have less latency, since everything
is copied and accessed from RAM.

####################################################
  Download pfSense CD ISO: 
    https://www.pfsense.org/download/
    Choose: "File Type" = Install
            "Architecture" = AMD64 (64-bit)
            "Platform" = CD Image (ISO) Installer
            "Mirror" = Frankfurt, Germany
  
  ----------------------------------
  Create virtual machine
  ----------------------------------
    All availible number of CPUs, >=512MB RAM, 10GB HDD, one or two network cards (if you want
    only proxy or firewall capability for LAN as well). For VirtualBox, enable: "System->Processor->Enable PAE/NX"
    and for network adapters (in my case for only one adapter) in "Network" set it as "Attached to:" = Bridged Adapter, 
    then go to "Advanced->Promiscuous Mode" and set it to "Allow All". Insert downloaded ISO image into the virtual drive.
    
  ----------------------------------
  Install pfSense
  ----------------------------------
    Run virtual machine. You will see a bootloader. Wait. After a while you will see a "Configure Console"
    dialog. Accept default options: "Accept these Settings". Then choose "Quick/Easy Install". Then choose
    "OK". Wait. Then choose "Standard Kernel". Then choose "Reboot". Wait. When the "Configure Console"
    dialog appears, in the menubar click on "Devices->CD/DVD devices->Remove disk from virtual drive".
    Choose "Force Unmount". Then in the menubar click on "Machine->Reset". The pfSense is now installed,
    now we need to configure it.
  
  ----------------------------------
  Configure pfSense
  ----------------------------------
    Continuing in the first boot process, you will be prompted with several questions:
    Should VLANs be set up now? n
    Enter the WAN interface name or 'a' for auto-detection (em0 or a): em0
    Enter the LAN interface name or 'a' for auto-detection: <press Enter>
    Do you want to proceed?: y
    Wait a moment, necessary services will be started. After that, you will be
    greated with a main menu and IP address. You should enter this address to 
    the internet browser, which will reveal pfSense web interface, in which the
    majority of things can be configured.
  
  ----------------------------------
  Enable SSH and disable state killing
  ----------------------------------
    pfSense can be easily troubleshooted from the web GUI, but it's always better
    to have SSH access to diagnose problems at deeper level.
    Under "System->Advanced" in category "Secure Shell" enable "Secure Shell Server".
    Click on "Save" button on the bottom of the page.
    Wait, until the page finishes loading. You can then log in via SSH with the same
    credentials as for the GUI.
    
    Next thing is disabling state killing, which resolves some instability or lost connection
    with proxy server later on after few hours.
    In "System->Advanced->Miscellaneous" find section "Schedules" and check " Schedule States" checkbox
    (Do not kill connections when schedule expires).
    Then in section "Gateway Monitoring" uncheck "State Killing on Gateway Failure".
    Click on "Save" button on the bottom of the page.
    Wait, until the page finishes loading.

    	
####################################################
SQUID
####################################################
  Squid is a proxy server which we will use to monitor and filter network traffic.

----------------------------------
Install Squid
----------------------------------
  "System->Package Manager->Availible Packages" and in the "Search Term" box enter "squid"
  and press Enter. Then install package "squid". Confirm.

----------------------------------
Configure Squid
----------------------------------
>>Local Cache
  First of all, we need to prepare caching space for Squid, beacuse Squid is a "caching" proxy :)
  Find "Hard Disk Cache Size" under "Squid Hard Disk Cache Settings". I set it to 500MB, but you can choose whatever size.
  Change " Memory Cache Size" under "Squid Memory Cache Settings" and set it to 64 (MB), and 
  set " Maximum Object Size in RAM" to 64.
  The size depends on number of users using the proxy, the amount of traffic, that they generate and availible hardware limitations.
  Other setting can be left on default settings.
  Click on "Save" button on the bottom of the page. Squid will prepare the cache partition.
  Wait, until the page finishes loading.

>>General tab
  Check "Enable Squid Proxy", "Keep Settings/Data".
  Proxy Interfaces: WAN, loopback (we have only one interface, but normally you want to select only LAN and loopback)
  Proxy port: we can leave it blank to use default (3128). I changed it to 8118, beacuse I previously ran and had set up Privoxy on other devices and I didn't want to change it on all of them again.
  Check "Allow Users on Interface".
  I didn't enable logging for the sake of stability and performance. But you can enable it int "Logging Settings" section.
  Logs are then availible on "Real Time" tab.
  Click on "Save" button on the bottom of the page.
  Wait, until the page finishes loading.

>>ACLs tab
  In "Allowed Subnets" enter your network address and mask in CIDR format. For me it was "192.168.0.0/25" (without quotes).
  I also created a small blacklist for blocking ads. Enter this into the "Blacklist" box:
  
.googlesyndication.com
.crashlytics.com
.google-analytics.com
.doubleclick.net
.adskeeper.co.uk
.bet365.com
.addthis.com
.liveadexchanger.com
.sitelement.sk
.ads.
  
  In category "Squid Allowed Ports" into box "ACL SafePorts" enter:
    80 443 22
  and for "ACL SSLPorts":
    443 22
  
  Click on "Save" button on the bottom of the page.
  Wait, until the page finishes loading.
  
----
Note
----
  You can also edit Blacklist and Whitelist directly via "Diagnostics->Edit File"
  Blacklist and whitelist file are in directory "/var/squid/acl/".
  There you can enter larger amount of rules and URLs than in web GUI,
  beacuse when you paste a large list of URLs in whitelist/blacklist, the GUI will NOT save the changes.
  
----------------------------------
Test Squid
----------------------------------
  Set web browsers or operating systems to use proxy.
    Firefox
      Menu->Options->Advanced->Network->Connection: Configure how Firefox connects to the Internet-> Settings...
      > Select "Manual proxy configuration" and enter the proxy server IP and port: IP address of pfSense and port (default is 3128). For convenience we can check "Use this proxy server for all protocols". 
      > Or select "Use system settings" which uses the proxy server of the operating system. Then you need to configure
      proxy in the operating system.
      Press Enter. The changes are applied immediately.
      
    Opera
      On Windows it opens proxy dialog window, on Linux you have to create a script with which we can force Opera to use
      our proxy server. Script:
      
#!/bin/bash
opera --proxy-server="192.168.0.2:8118"
    
    Windows 10
      Start->Settings->Network & Internet->Proxy.
      Under "Manual proxy setup" enable "Use proxy server".
      In the "Address" field enter IP address of the proxy server (IP address of pfSense).
      In the "Port" field enter the port, on which the proxy server listens
      
    Linux
      Haven't bothered :) I rather set it up in browsers for the sake of simplicity.
    

####################################################
SQUIDGUARD
####################################################
  SquidGuard is a automated content filtering tool for Squid.
  It is used to filter larger amount of URLs, beacuse in pfSense, Squid alone is not able to filter
  large number of URLs (sadly), although Squid is able to whitelist / blacklist small amount of pages.

----------------------------------
Install SquidGuard
----------------------------------
  "System->Package Manager->Availible Packages" and in the "Search Term" box enter "squidGuard"
  and press Enter. Then install package "squidGuard". Confirm.

----------------------------------
Configure SquidGuard package
----------------------------------
  >>General Settings tab
    In "Logging options" section disable "Enable GUI log", "Enable log", "Enable log rotation".
    In "Miscellaneous" section enable "Clean Advertising".
    In "Blacklist options" section enable "Blacklist". In the "Blacklist URL" enter:
      http://www.shallalist.de/Downloads/shallalist.tar.gz
    Click on "Save" button on the bottom of the page.
    Wait, until the page finishes loading.
  
  >>Blacklist tab
    Keep smashing the download button. Literally. It's a bug, that the list will not download after one click on the "Download"
    button. You should also see the blacklist URL in the text field. Keep clicking on the "Download" button until it starts
    downloading it. Just keep clicking ;)
    After the list is installed, go to "Common ACL" tab.
    
  >>Common ACL
    You should see next to "Target Rules" the "Target Rules List". Click on the plus sign.
    Select the categories in "Target Categories", that should be blocked by selecting "deny" in the drop down menu.
    The last category "Default access [all]" set to "allow".
    Enable "Log".
    Click on "Save" button on the bottom of the page.
    Wait, until the page finishes loading.
    
  >>General settings
    Check the "Enable" checkbox to enable SquidGuard. Do the "Update procedure" (explained below).
  
    UPDATE PROCEDURE
    Everytime we change the configuration of Squid or SquidGuardian, the SquidGuard service needs to be restarted.
    In order to do so, we need to perform the "Update procedure", to force the loading of new settings.
      Stepps:
        -Uncheck "Enable SquidGuard". This disables SquidGuard.
        -Click on "Save" button on the bottom of the page. Wait, until the page finishes loading.
        -Click on "Apply" button underneath the checkbox "Enable SquidGuard". Wait, until the page finishes loading.
        -Check "Enable SquidGuard". This enables SquidGuard.
        -Click on "Save" button on the bottom of the page. Wait, until the page finishes loading.
        -Click on "Apply" button underneath the checkbox "Enable SquidGuard". Wait, until the page finishes loading.
    
----------------------------------
Test SquidGuard
----------------------------------
  Use these sites to check, whether ad-blocking is working. Reload the pages with the proxy server enabled and disabled
  to see, if ads are blocked by the proxy server.

  Enable "DNS Resolver" in "Services->DNS Resolver" and check "Enable DNS resolver".
  In "Network Interfaces" choose "All".
  In "Outgoing Network Interfaces" choose "All".
  The rest of the settings we can leave on default.
  Click on "Save" button on the bottom of the page.
  Wait, until the page finishes loading.
  
  The pages should now load faster.

####################################################

####################################################
  The SquidGuard should be up an runnig. You set it and forget it.
  But if you see a page that should load, but is not, or a page that shouldn't load, but it is
  check the Whitelist or Blacklist fields in Squid ACLs for finer control.

Increasing stability ...
  Maybe you want to add a cron job, when loading pages is slower over time. This is due to
  increasing RAM consumption of Squid. I had only 512MB of RAM availible to pfSense.
  One solution to this is to reboot pfSense once a day. I decided to reboot the (virtual) machine
  every day at 3:30 AM. I created a cron job to do this for me.
  
  Firstly, we need to install cron. Go to "System->Package Manager->Availible Packages".
  In "Search term" field enter "cron" and press Enter. Wait until the install finishes.
  
  Now go to "Services->Cron".
  Click on "Add" button/tab.
  I wanted to reboot pfSense every day at 3:30. so I set it up as follows:
    -Minute:              30
    -Hour:                3
    -Day of the Month:    *
    -Month of the Year:   *
    -Day of the Week:     *
    -User:                root
    -Command:             /sbin/reboot
    
  Click on "Save" button on the bottom of the page.
  Wait, until the page finishes loading.
  The cron job for pfSense automatic rebooting is now set up and active.

Tuning
####################################################
-------------------------------------------
  Tunning Squid for more performance.
-------------------------------------------
  >"System->Advanced->System Tunables"
  vfs.read_max: 128
  kern.ipc.nmbclusters: 32768
  
  If any of these variables is not listed, create it via pressing the "New" button.
  Save, then Apply.

-------------------------------------------
  SSD tuning
-------------------------------------------
  >Disable swap.
    -Log in into pfSense via SSH.
    -In the main menu press "8" and hit Enter.
    -Check if swap is enabled:

swapctl -l
    
    Output:
    
Device:       1024-blocks     Used:
/dev/label/swap0   1048572         0

    -In my case, the swap partition is enabled, beacuse it lists the total amount of swap space and amount of used space. If it's not listing swap size, swap is turned off.
    -The swap partition was listed under Device as "/dev/label/swap0".
    -Disable swap partition:

swapoff /dev/label/swap0

    -Check if swap has been disabled:
    
swapctl -l

    -The command should only list this:

Device:       1024-blocks     Used:

    which means, the swap has been successfuly disabled.
   
  >Increase amount of total availible RAM - I think 512MB of RAM is plenty sufficient for my purposes.
    
  >Disable all logging (and enable it only when needed)
    "Status->System Logs->Settings"
    Uncheck EVERYTHING.
    Check "Local Logging: Disable writing log files to the local disk"
    Click on "Reset log files" button. Press "OK".
    Save.
  
  >Use overprovisioning on host system
    Reserve 20% of your SSD space as unformatted partition. The SSD will then use it to move data around.
    
  >Reinstall pfSense in "nanoBSD" mode for embedded systems. In "nanoBSD" mode, pfSense keeps most of the things in RAM, so it spares the SSD/memory card. The I/O operations are also optimized (minimalized).

  Download pfSense CD ISO: 
    https://www.pfsense.org/download/
    Choose: "File Type" = Install
            "Architecture" = AMD64 (64-bit)
            "Platform" = Embedded (nanoBSD)
            "Console" = VGA (or you can choose Serial, if you can handle it in VirtualBox :D )
            "Media Size" = 2GB (This is effectivlely the size of your non-volatile storage. I chose 2GB, but it really doesn't matter much. Maybe when you require more packages to be installed)
            "Mirror" = Frankfurt, Germany
            
This will download a compressed IMG archive with preinstalled pfSense that only needs to be configured.
  
  ----------------------------------
  Create virtual machine
  ----------------------------------
    All availible number of CPUs, >512MB RAM, 10GB HDD, one or two network cards (if you want
    only proxy or firewall capability for LAN as well). For VirtualBox, enable: "System->Processor->Enable PAE/NX"
    and for network adapters (in my case for only one adapter) in "Network" set it as "Attached to:" = Bridged Adapter,
    then go to "Advanced->Promiscuous Mode" and set it to "Allow All".
    
    You can also disable audio and USB ports in virtual machine settings - you won't probably need it.
    
    Now go to "Storage". We will continue with making a virtual HDD from our downloaded IMG archive.
    
  ----------------------------------
  Creating virtual HDD
  ----------------------------------
    Now we will decompress the file we downloaded earlier. Open a terminal/command prompt.
    
    Decompress the .gz to get a plain disk image .img file (you need pfSense-2.0.1-RELEASE-4g-i386-nanobsd_vga.img).
    For extraction in Linux, I like to use "dtrx" utility. It makes extracting archives so much easier ... :)
    In Windows use WinRAR or whatever you like :)
    
dtrx <name_of_the_pfsense_archive>.img.gz
    
    Convert the disk image to a virtual hard disk using this command:

VBoxManage convertfromraw <name_of_the_pfsense_archive>.img <name_of_the_pfsense_archive>.vdi

    Move to the same directory as the pfSense virtual machine:
    
mv <name_of_the_pfsense_archive>.vdi ~/VirtualBox\ VMs/<name_of_the_pfsense_virtual_machine>

    Don't worry if the .vdi file will be much smaller.
    It will actually be a dynamic virtual disk, which physically occupies only the amount of data which is not empty.
  
  Connect created .vdi disk to the virtual machine. Go to "Settings->Storage", click on existing virtual HDD.
  Then click on the small HDD icon on the right side. From the drop down menu choose "Choose Virtual Hard Disk File".
  Navigate to the virtual machine directory and choose the new .vdi file. Press "Open".
  
  Close virtual machine setting by clicking on "OK" button.
  
  ----------------------------------
  Configure pfSense
  ----------------------------------
  Run the virtual machine. You will see a bootloader. Wait.
  Continuing in the first boot process, you will be prompted with several questions:
    Should VLANs be set up now? n
    Enter the WAN interface name or 'a' for auto-detection (em0 or a): em0
    Enter the LAN interface name or 'a' for auto-detection: <press Enter>
    Do you want to proceed?: y
    Wait a moment, necessary services will be started. After that, you will be
    greated with a main menu and IP address. You should enter this address to 
    the internet browser, which will reveal pfSense web interface, in which the
    majority of things can be configured.
    
  The rest is the same as in HDD install.
