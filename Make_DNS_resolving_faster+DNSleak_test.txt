To check how fast is your resolving speed, download "namebench" utility from
  https://code.google.com/archive/p/namebench/downloads
  
Install it, open it and run it. The binary "namebench.exe" can be found in "%temp%"
directory.

Click on "Start Benchmark" and wait until it finishes.

After a while, namebench will generate a HTML file with benchmark result which 
is automatically opened by the browser. Then make changes accordingly.

Additionaly you can check for "DNS leaks", if your DNS provider forwards resolving
information to 3rd parties. Go to https://dnsleaktest.com/ and select either standard
or extended test. If leaks had been detected, you can eventually set the DNS addresses
to other DNS provider or set up an OpenVPN client/server.
