The Ultimate Network-wide Adblocker

I run Privoxy and Pi-hole as two seperate virtual machines in VirtualBox.
Together they can block every possible advertisment but the Youtube ones.
Both machines are running under Ubuntu Server 16.04.2 x64, with bridged
networking adapter (promiscuous mode "Allow all") and 256 MB RAM.

========================================================================================
PART 1 - Privoxy
========================================================================================

Install Privoxy:

  sudo apt-get update
  sudo apt-get upgrade
  sudo apt-get install privoxy
  
  sudo nano /etc/network/interfaces
  Underneath is my "interfaces" file

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# This file describes the network interfaces available on your system
# and how to activate them. For more information, see interfaces(5).

source /etc/network/interfaces.d/*

# The loopback network interface
auto lo
iface lo inet loopback

# The primary network interface
auto enp0s3
iface enp0s3 inet static
        address 192.168.0.2
        netmask 255.255.255.128
        gateway 192.168.0.1
        dns-nameserver 8.8.8.8
        dns-nameserver 8.8.4.4
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    
  sudo nano /etc/privoxy/config
  
In this file, edit line "listen-address" to your IP and port; usually your 
  local IP address (which we already set in /etc/network/interfaces) and standard port (8118).
  
Run it after boot

  sudo systemctl enable privoxy

Save and exit. Reboot the machine (beacuse we set a static IP address and restarting the
networking service doesn't get rid of the DHCP address):

  sudo reboot
  
Now we will check, if privoxy works.

Now set the proxy in your operating system / browser. After that you can enjoy
browsing almost without ads. Some ad will show, some pop-ups might show, the 
youtube ads are not blocked, but the vast majority of annoying ads will be gone
in entire network.
	
Now we're gonna import EasyList into privoxy for additional list of advertisment
domains and URLs.
It is not officialy supported and some utilities to provide the conversion are needed. 
But on the site
https://projects.zubr.me/wiki/adblock2privoxyDownloads
is an up-to-date EasyList, ready to be imported to privoxy. As I found out,
it is pretty sufficient.

You can also use adblock2privoxy utility to automatically update and convert
EasyList to privoxy. Link: https://projects.zubr.me/wiki/adblock2privoxy. Or even
better, you can download updated privoxy ready EasyList from
https://projects.zubr.me/wiki/adblock2privoxyDownloads and then run it through
adblock2privoxy. Debian "deb" package should be listed on the same site as well.

  cd ~
  wget https://s3.amazonaws.com/ab2p/adblock2privoxy_1.4.2_amd64.debian8.deb
  sudo dpkg -i adblock2privoxy_1.4.2_amd64.debian8.deb
  wget https://s3.amazonaws.com/ab2p/ab2p.easylist.7z
  sudo apt-get install p7zip-full
  7z x ab2p.easylist.7z
  sudo mkdir -p /var/www/privoxy
  sudo mv ab2p.easylist /var/www/privoxy
  cd /var/www/privoxy
  sudo cp ./ab2p.easylist/privoxy/* /etc/privoxy
  sudo nano /etc/privoxy/config
  
Search for "actionsfile" (Ctrl+W). add there these lines:
  actionsfile ab2p.system.action
  actionsfile ab2p.action

Search for "filterfile" (Ctrl+W). add there these lines:
  filterfile ab2p.system.filter
  filterfile ab2p.filter
  
Save it and exit. Then restart privoxy:

  sudo service privoxy restart

Now we're gonna finish this by installing web server, which is going to filter ad
elements on webpages i.e. hiding the blank space of an advertisment banner
(if possible). The web server will filter out the ad banners from the page
using CSS files located in "web" folder. Now we're going to set up web server and
privoxy for element filtering.

Install Apache webserver:

  sudo apt-get install apache2
  
Edit this file:

  sudo nano /etc/apache2/sites-available/000-default.conf
  
Replace it's contents with this (!! REPLACE "192.168.0.2" in "ServerName" attribute
with your domain name or IP address of the web server i.e. local IP address of the 
computer!!) (!! REPLACE the path in "DocumentRoot" attribute with the path, where 
you have saved your web folder with CSS files!!):

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

<VirtualHost *:80>
      #ab2p css domain name (optional, should be equal to --domainCSS parameter)
      ServerName 192.168.0.2

      #root = --webDir parameter value
      DocumentRoot /var/www/privoxy/ab2p.easylist/web


      RewriteEngine on

      # first reverse domain names order
      RewriteRule ^/([^/]*?)\.([^/.]+)(?:\.([^/.]+))?(?:\.([^/.]+))?(?:\.([^/.]$

      # then try to get CSS for current domain
      # if it is unavailable - get CSS for parent domain
      RewriteCond %{DOCUMENT_ROOT}/%{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
      RewriteRule (^.*/+)[^/]+/+ab2p.css$ $1ab2p.css [N]
</VirtualHost>

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Save and exit.
Edit following file:

  sudo nano /etc/privoxy/ab2p.system.filter

and replace all occurences of "www.example.com" with your domain name or IP 
address ("Ctrl + \", enter "www.example.com" and then enter your domain
name or IP address of your web server).

If you would restart the apache2 web server now, it will complain that it doesn't
know the command "RewriteEngine". We have to manually enable it:

  sudo a2enmod rewrite
  
Restart privoxy and apache2:

  sudo service privoxy restart
  sudo service apache2 restart

Now everything should be done on the server side. Now you have to set up the client
machines and edit proxy server settings in browser or operating system.

Enjoy server wide adblocking with adblock plus level of support.

========================================================================================
PART 2 - Pi-hole
========================================================================================

After installing Debian based distro, install Pi-hole with the official script:

  cd
  wget https://install.pi-hole.net

Check which files were downloaded

  ls
  
In my case the file had a name "index.html". I'll rename it to "pihole_install.sh"

  mv index.html pihole_install.sh
   
Make the script executable and run it
 
  chmod +x pihole_install.sh
  sudo ./pihole_install.sh
   
Follow the installer, it will guide you with the setup. Pay attention when it will
ask you for the IP address.
After the installation, change the admin password for web   
   
  pihole -a -p  raspberry
   
Reboot machine.

  sudo reboot
  
After reboot, you can log in to the web interface of Pi-hole @ 
  
  192.168.0.3/admin
or
  pi.hole/admin
  
Then you can check, if the counters go up. Thats a sign, it's working. Now you will not
see anything, beacuse we need to proceed to the next part.

========================================================================================
PART 3 - Set Privoxy to use Pi-hole
========================================================================================

Go to Privoxy machine and open the "interfaces" file

  sudo nano /etc/networking/interfaces
  
Comment out all lines with the keywork "dns-nameserver".
Add a new line with Pi-hole DNS address:

  dns-nameserver 192.168.0.3

The final config will look like this:

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# This file describes the network interfaces available on your system
# and how to activate them. For more information, see interfaces(5).

source /etc/network/interfaces.d/*

# The loopback network interface
auto lo
iface lo inet loopback

# The primary network interface
auto enp0s3
iface enp0s3 inet static
        address 192.168.0.2
        netmask 255.255.255.128
        gateway 192.168.0.1
#       dns-nameserver 8.8.8.8
        dns-nameserver 192.168.0.3

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The 8.8.8.8 DNS server is there only as a fallback, if something goes wrong.
Restart networking

  sudo service networking restart
  
Then check out the Pi-hole web interface. Now normally browse the internet. Try to load
one or two webpages. Go back to Pi-hole web interface and check, if the resolving
is working. The "Query" counters should go up.

At this point the ultimate adblocker is done. You may also check part 4 for final tuning
of the browsing experience.

========================================================================================
PART 4 - When loading the page takes too long ...
========================================================================================

The browsing experience should be relatively good with quite short loading times. But 
in case of long loading times for certain webpages, we will whitelist it in Pi-hole and
Privoxy simultaneously, just to be sure.

To be certain, that it is the proxy server, that's causing long loading times, disable 
it in the browser or operating system and then load the same page again. If it loads 
faster, then the Privoxy or Pi-hole is a problem.

Pi-hole whitelisting:
  Log in to the web interface, on the left menu bar click on "Whitelist", type the
  domain and click on "Add" to add it to the whitelisted domains.
  
  Try loading the page again. If it loads faster, great. Otherwise proceed with Privoxy
  whitelisting.

Privoxy whitelisting:
  Log into the Privoxy machine via SSH and go to "/etc/privoxy"
    cd /etc/privoxy
  Then edit the "users.action" file:
    sudo nano users.action
  Find the phrase "{ -block }" -> Ctrl+W and then type "{ -block }" without quotes.
  Press enter.
  Right underneath { -block } directive enter the domain or URL, that you want to
  whitelist.
  Save it and exit. Ctrl + O then Y then Enter then Ctrl + X
  Restart Privoxy
    sudo service privoxy restart
  
  The page should now load faster.
  

========================================================================================
PART 5 - Start Privoxy and Pi-hole after login (for Arch Linux)
========================================================================================  
In Arch, as opposed from Debian, Privoxy doesn't start automatically after reboot.
Therefore I decided to run Privoxy natively and Pi-hole in VirtalBox. I couldn't run
Privoxy and Pi-hole natively at the same time, beacuse it would conflict. I tried
to enable Privoxy after startup using systemctl (sudo systemctl enable privoxy), but
it always failed to run i.e. I wasn't able to browse Internet. FBeacuse of that,
Privoxy and Pi-hole virtual machine are started after login by the desktop enviroment
(in my case LXDE).

  nano ~/.config/lxsession/LXDE/autostart

Add these lines

  @VBoxManage startvm pihole --type headless
  /usr/bin/privoxy --no-daemon /home/htpc/privoxy/config

Save and exit. Reboot and check if you have Internet connectivity.
