  sudo apt-get update
  sudo apt-get upgrade
  sudo apt-get install privoxy
  sudo nano /etc/privoxy/config
	Edit line "listen-address" to your IP and port; usually your local IP address
	standard port

Save and exit. Restart privoxy:

  sudo service privoxy restart
  
Now we will check, if privoxy works.

Now set the proxy in your operating system / browser. After that you can enjoy
browsing almost without ads. Some ad will show, some pop-ups might show, the 
youtube ads are not blocked, but the vast majority of annoying ads will be gone
in entire network.
	
Now we're gonna import EasyList into privoxy for additional list of advertisment
domains and URLs.
It is not officialy supported and some utilities to provide the conversion are needed. 
But on the site
https://projects.zubr.me/wiki/adblock2privoxyDownloads
is an up-to-date EasyList, ready to be imported to privoxy. As I found out,
it is pretty sufficient. I am using only the action file, beacuse the filter file
slows down the browsing too much. Therefore I will not cover the filter file
setup.

You can also use adblock2privoxy utility to automatically update and convert
EasyList to privoxy. Link: https://projects.zubr.me/wiki/adblock2privoxy. Or even
better, you can download updated privoxy ready EasyList from
https://projects.zubr.me/wiki/adblock2privoxyDownloads and then run it through
adblock2privoxy. Debian "deb" package should be listed on the same site as well.

  cd ~
  wget https://s3.amazonaws.com/ab2p/adblock2privoxy_1.4.2_amd64.debian8.deb
  sudo dpkg -i adblock2privoxy_1.4.2_amd64.debian8.deb
  wget https://s3.amazonaws.com/ab2p/ab2p.easylist.7z
  sudo apt-get install p7zip-full
  7z x ab2p.easylist.7z
  sudo mv /etc/privoxy/user.action user.action.original
  sudo cp ./ab2p.easylist/privoxy/* /etc/privoxy
  sudo nano /etc/privoxy/config
  
  search for "actionsfile" (Ctrl+W) . add there these lines:
  
actionsfile ab2p.system.action
actionsfile ab2p.action
filterfile ab2p.system.filter
filterfile ab2p.filter
  
Save it and exit. Then restart privoxy:

  sudo service privoxy restart
  
Enjoy server wide adblocking with adblock plus level of support.
